## DenseNet Implementation for Analysis of 3D Full Body MRTs

Implementation of a DenseConvNet with 'Bottleneck'- and 'Transition'-layers for the analysis and prediction of Diabetes related features in three-dimensional full-body MRT scans. Before the final fully-connected layers leading to the individual output nodes i.e. predictions, an embebedding layer is optimized on all of the given target labels. This embedding is used for clusterings and to reveal patterns through TSNE.

### Data

The data used for this work consisted of approximately 2.5k full-body MRT scans.
Due to signed NDAs I cannot make this data publicly available.

Three-dimensional image arrays to be used with the code should be stored in .....

### Code

The code is written in Python and should be easily runnable by executing the main script.

### Results

Some of the resulting plots
